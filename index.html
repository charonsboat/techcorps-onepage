            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <h3>Do not brag about your Sends:</h3>
            <p>Congratulations! You sent a 5.12! The reality of the world is that not everyone cares. Coming up to a fellow group of climbers and announcing your accomplishments can seem arrogant, unwarranted, and downright annoying. Let your climbing be a personal accomplishment to share with you and your belayer, maybe a close friend, post it on Facebook or something, but don’t announce it like you’ve discovered the cure for polio. If you want to share your send with someone, find the person who set it, and thank them for giving you the opportunity to climb their route.  </p>

            <h3>Downgrading and Upgrading:</h3>
            <p>You might be a pretty strong climber, and I’m sure that once you have climbed at Aiguille long enough, you might get a sense of how difficult a route or problem is before it is even graded. But you are not always correct. Everyone is going to have different opinions on grading, indoors and outdoors, because of different climbing styles. So don’t go to a random climber and tell them that their V4 project is actually V3 because you think so. And don’t complain to your fellow climber because you can’t reach something, or you can’t do one move that there is no way that the route is 5.11. If the climbing universe revolved around you, you can be the climbing Moses and hold up the Ten Commandments of the definitions of each grade.</p>

            <h3>Pay Attention to the Direction of the Route/Problem:</h3>
            <p>When you are climbing, the person who started climbing first has the priority on the wall. If you might have noticed, a lot of the routes and problems that coexist on the same walls intersect at times. You should NEVER start a route/problem without checking to see if they intersect. If you are leading and then you notice that someone is climbing right underneath you because they didn’t realize that the route crossed into the other, not only does it put both climbers in a dangerous situation, but it is obnoxious and typically forces one of the climbers to stop. Imagine, you are bouldering. You are on the crux move of your project. You stick the move. You go to move to the next move knowing that the finish is near. And then you see it. Another climber that started after you appears, blocking the last footchip of the problem. And of course you’re pumped and have to let go because you’ve got nothing left. Now you want to kill that climber! Think about it the next time you put your hands on the start hold.</p>

            <h2>First Aid</h2>

            <h3>Know First Aid</h3>

            <p>If you’re out climbing on the cliffs or in the mountains, there is always the possibility for injury to either yourself or your climbing partners. If you carry a basic first aid kit and know how to assess injuries and to use your first aid supplies, it can make a big difference in the outcome. Remember that using your head, knowing what to do in a medical emergency situation, is the most important part of your first aid kit.
</p>
<h3>
            Accidents Happen
</h3>
<p>
            Accidents happen in the great outdoors when you’re out climbing. You trip and sprain an ankle. You fall and break a leg or arm. You get hit with loose rock and suffer a head injury. If you’re carrying a basic first aid kit in your climbing pack, then you can mitigate some of the damage from these injuries. You’ll be able to patch yourself or your buddy up enough so that everything isn’t as bad as it could be. You’ll be able to survive until you get to a hospital.
</p>

<h3>
            Take First Aid Classes
</h3>
<p>
            The crux, of course, is to know how to use your first aid supplies. You can carry the biggest first aid kit you can buy but if you don’t know first aid then it’s under-utilized. If you’re a going to be a serious and competent climber, alpinist, and outdoorsman, then you need to have more than a passing knowledge of first aid. The best and easiest way to learn first aid is to take an American Red Cross class in CPR and first aid. They prepare you to deal with life-threatening emergencies. If you don’t have time for a class or there are none nearby, then take Red Cross on-line training and work at your own pace.
</p>
<p>
            If you took a class in the past, your knowledge has probably slipped. It’s good to do a refresher course every year to keep your first aid skills up to date.
</p>

<h3>
            Treat Basic Injuries
</h3>
<p>
            Climbing accidents usually fall in two categories—minor injuries and catastrophic emergencies. The essential first aid supplies you carry should cover the in-between injuries. Before you put together or buy your first aid kit, it’s a good idea to think about common climbing injuries and then fill your kit with supplies to treat those ailments. Basically you should be able to treat wounds, bleeding, blisters, headache, pain, and broken bones. It’s difficult to treat traumatic injuries with the basic supplies you’ll carry. It’s best in those situations to get help and helicopter immediately and get the patient to a trauma center.
</p>

<h3>
            First Aid Supplies to Carry
</h3>
<p>
            What should you carry in your basic climbing first aid kit? It’s difficult to decide because you want to keep the kit small and lightweight, but you also want to have enough to treat severe injuries. It’s up to you to find that balance. You can buy prepackaged first aid kits and they’re pretty good but you also should consider personalizing the kit by adding items you might need. For day-long climbing trips, I keep my kit small, weighing about six ounces. For longer multi-day trips that include backcountry hiking, it’s worthwhile to carry a bigger kit, especially since you’ll be farther from help. Just keep it simple and know how to use it.
